    CHMM POST to upload a file to rejection files API test
    # NOTE: Organisation with Id = c7e522cc-8d46-4218-8e83-70b9a3d15f38 and email address = triad.test.acc.4+mfr1@gmail.com is present in the DB


    Background: Create a manufacturer account
    
    Scenario Outline: 1. Verify that POST rejection files by a manufacturer user returns 200

        Given the user has authentication token for "<authEmailId>" email id
        And the user have a manufacturer onboarding application request body json with the following data:
            | key                        | value                        |
            | isOnBehalfOfGroup          | <isOnBehalfOfGroup>          |
            | organisationName           | newRandom                    |
            | companyNumber              | newRandom                    |
            | isFossilFuelBoilerSeller   | <isFossilFuelBoilerSeller>   |
            | manufacturerUserEmailId    | <manufacturerUserEmailId>    |
            | manufacturerSROUserEmailId | <manufacturerSROUserEmailId> |
            | isResponsibleOfficer       | <isResponsibleOfficer>       |
            | creditTransferOptIn        | <creditTransferOptIn>        |
            | creditTransferEmailId      | <creditTransferEmailId>      |
        And the user send a POST request to "/identity/organisations/onboard" with json body and authentication token to submit manufacturer onboarding application
        And the user has the manufacturer onboarding application json for the new organisation

        When the user send a POST request to "/identity/organisations/organisationId/rejection-files/upload" to upload "<fileNames>" file for "files" with authentication token

        Then the response status code should be 200
        Examples:
